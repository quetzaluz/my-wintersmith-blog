Last Saturday at <a title="Hack Reactor" href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> we had an in-class assignment where we had to validate more than fifteen fields in a form. As I wrote my first regular expression, or regex, and saw it at work, I squealed with delight.

In the past I've worked for non-profits that maintain mailing lists and other simple databases with records that are populated by volunteers. I remember hearing coworkers complain about nonsensical email data or hard to query, inconsistently formatted phone-numbers.

I love learning about tools that can remedy the problems I've seen less code savvy folks struggle with in the past. Here is the <a title="Form with regex validation." href="http://bits.cydbot.com/regex/val.html">basic form</a> I made with regex validation. We're assigned multiple projects a day at Hack Reactor, and the above is just what I managed to get done in last two hours of our lab time.
