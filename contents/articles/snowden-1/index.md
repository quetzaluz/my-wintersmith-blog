Yesterday I saw the words "Snowden = Hero" written in chalk at the Montgomery BART station in SF. It's fitting that "Snowden = Hero" be written in chalk, because that statement should be erased in the face of the facts.

If I were the type of commuter to carry chalk with me everywhere I went, I might have written these statements beneath "Snowden = Hero."

<strong>Snowden = Old News</strong>

If you were <a title="Washington Post - House approves wiretapping" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/04/AR2007080400285.html?nav=rss_politics" target="_blank">paying attention to congress in 2007</a>, or <a title="Nova - The Spy Factory" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/spy-factory.html" target="_blank">watching PBS around this time</a>, you would have long been aware of pretty much everything Snowden leaked regarding surveillance in the US and the FISA courts. The only difference is that Snowden released documents related to this at a time when people are hostile towards the Obama administration.

If Snowden's 'revelations' have taught us anything, it's that we should all be reading the newspaper and watching PBS more, and that we should be aware of how the exact same story can be overlooked during one administration and trumped up in the next.

<strong>Snowden = Hypocrite</strong>

According to this <a title="Washington Post" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/snowden-voiced-contempt-for-leakers-in-newly-disclosed-chat-logs-from-2009/2013/06/26/e88f7412-de8e-11e2-963a-72d740e88c12_story.html?hpid=z2" target="_blank">recent article by the Washington Post</a>, Snowden used to condemn leakers widely across the internet, stating among other things that “They’re reporting classified [expletive]...You don’t put that [expletive] in the NEWSPAPER.” Of course Snowden now claims that "over time that awareness of wrongdoing sort of builds up and you feel compelled to talk about [it]." Sure, Snowden, I'll allow you to change your opinion--It's been amusing to see you evolve from an angry young man with a fondness for CAPSLOCK and vulgarity into a spotless matyr. However, when politicians change their opinions like this, they are called flip-floppers or hypocrites.

<strong>Snowden = Playground Snitch</strong>

If working two years as a teacher in a public school taught me anything, it is that no one likes snitches. Whenever kids on the playground would run from their group of friends to tattle about them to another group of kids, both groups of kids would end up hating the snitch because neither group would have any reason to trust them.

Snowden <a title="The China Daily" href="http://world.time.com/2013/06/13/beijing-reacts-to-snowden-claims-u-s-hacked-hundreds-of-chinese-targets/" target="_blank">released confidential documents to Chinese authorities</a> with the hope of ingratiating himself and winning asylum in Hong Kong -- and look at how spectacularly that has worked out for him. At best his move inspired a <a title="Russia Today Article" href="http://rt.com/news/snowden-us-hong-kong-267/">delay to his extradition</a>, but he certainly didn't get to stay. I only wonder if Snowden will have any <del>lunch money</del> confidential documents left to ply favors with.

<strong>Snowden = Attention Whore</strong>

The greatest ally Snowden has won in this mess is <a title="Wikileaks statement about Snowden" href="http://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-Statement-On-Edward,253.html?updated" target="_blank">Wikileaks</a>. However, his path towards joining the Wikileaks hall of fame has been one of the clumsiest and most self-aggrandizing I've seen. For someone who values privacy, Snowden has been more than happy to reveal anything and everything as he tries to paint himself as hero. Don't you know it's rude to talk about your salary, let alone <a title="Booz Allen reveals salary was $122k, not $200k" href="http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2013/06/11/contractor-um-snowden-didnt-make-200000/" target="_blank">lie about your salary and exaggerate it</a>?

If you want to see Snowden as a hero, you are perfectly entitled to do so, because what he has done is brave. However, stupidity and egoism are often symptoms of bravery (or perhaps it's the other way around). As easily as you can argue that "Snowden = Hero," you can argue that he equals any of the other things above.
